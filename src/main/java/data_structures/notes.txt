        indexed
        fixed-size
        hold items of the same data type
        2-dimensional arrays = array of arrays
        3-dimensional arrays = array of (arrays of arrays)
        traverse, search, getByIndex, add, remove
        Application:
            building blocks for other data structures
            in different sorting algorithms
    ArrayList (Vector)
        indexed
        hold items of the same data type
        NOT fixed-size
        traverse, search, getByIndex, add, remove
        Application:
            Most used data structure
    LinkedList

        NOT indexed
        hold items of the same data type
        NOT fixed-size
        access data sequentially
        random access is not possible
        traverse, search, getByIndex, add, remove
        Application:
            Used in switching between programs using Alt + Tab
            Where adding, removing elements anywhere in the list
    Stack
        LIFO (Last In First Out)
        NOT indexed
        hold items of the same data type
        NOT fixed-size
        push and pope
        peek, isEmpty, isFull
        Applications:
            Used for expression evaluation
            Implement function calls in recursion programming
    Queue
        FIFO (First In First Out)
        NOT indexed
        hold items of the same data type
        NOT fixed-size
        enqueue and dequeue
        peek, isEmpty, isFull
        Applications:
            Used to manage threads in multithreading.
            Used to implement queuing systems
Non-linear data structures
    Hash
        HashMap
            key-value structure
            efficient in inserting and searching
            Using the hash function, we calculate the index of the table (slot) to which each value goes
        HashSet
    Trees
        Binary tree
        Binary search tree
        AVL tree
        Red-black tree
        TreeMap and TreeSet
    Heap
        MaxHeap
        MinHeap
    Graphs
